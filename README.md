# terbium02
Work in progress 6502 emulator in C. Not finished, but currently capable of executing some instructions.

## How to use
put the file you want in the ROMs folder, rename to program.bin

## Whats not here
+ Most instructions still need to be finished, it is capable of running simple programs though
+ Counting cycles
+ Interrupts

and probably a bit more, but mostly this that I want to eventually add
